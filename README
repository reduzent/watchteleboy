watchteleboy
============

is a script to watch and record live TV streams from 
http://www.teleboy.ch without browser nor flash.

THIS MOST LIKELY WORKS ONLY FROM SWITZERLAND, SINCE THE IPTV SERVICE
FROM TELEBOY.CH IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO SWISS IP ADDRESSES.

News
----

Since version 1.21 there is no need to have avconv installed anymore. Instead, the 
HLS stream receiver is implemented in bash with curl. By not sticking strictly to
the HLS protocol, watchteleboy now is able to watch shows up to 6 hours after their
air time. Just use the option --starttime when you want to watch a missed show.


Requirements
------------

This script is based on the following binary programs (make sure
you have them installed):

     o One of the following media players:
       * omxplayer (recommended on Rasperry Pi)
       * mpv (recommended on most Linux systems)
       * mplayer (if mpv is not available)
       * vlc (not well tested)

     o crontab

     o date

     o jq - JSON processor for the cmdline

     o curl

     o whiptail (optional, used for 'nice' dialogs)


Usage
-----

Do 'watchteleboy --help' in order to get a quick summary of the available
options. When invoked without options it starts in interactive mode.
