IMPORTANT NOTICE:

As of late June 2015, Teleboy AG reworked their service and watchteleboy is
not functional anymore. It appears they switched from RTMP to HTTP as
transport protocol. Their service needs to be reverse-engineered again in
order to provide a functional script. My skills and time are limited, 
so please do not expect a working version soon. Any help is greatly
appreciated.

is a script to watch and record live TV streams from 
http://www.teleboy.ch without browser nor flash.

The service was reverse-engineered  by:
Alexander Tuchaček

THIS MOST LIKELY WORKS ONLY FROM SWITZERLAND, SINCE THE IPTV SERVICE
FROM TELEBOY.CH IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO SWISS IP ADDRESSES.

Requirements
------------

This script is based on the following binary programs:

     o MPlayer - The Movie Player
       Most likely mplayer is delivered by your distribution. If you need
       a bleeding edge version, go to:
       http://www.mplayerhq.hu/

     o rtmpdump - a dumping tool for rtmp streams
       http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/

     o wget

     o crontab

     o date

     o whiptail


Usage
-----

Do 'watchteleboy --help' in order to get a quick summary of the available
options. When invoked without options it starts in interactive mode.


Bugs
----

  * Sometimes in live watching mode, streaming is suddenly terminated.
